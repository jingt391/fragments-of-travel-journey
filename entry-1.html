                Visiting Victoria Island is like stepping into a storybook, 
                its charm unfolding with every cobbled street and scenic harbor. 
                My mom and I enjoyed afternoon tea at a quaint tea house nestled in a lush garden. 
                The clinking of cups intertwined with the soothing aroma of freshly brewed tea and warm scones. 
                Just as I savored the moment, the waiter approached me with a smile and handed me a fresh flower, 
                its petals blooming with vibrant colors in the soft ambiance. 
                Touched by this simple yet profound gesture, I carefully tucked the flower away and carried it with me, 
                reminding myself of the gentle beauty and kindness of this island that made this experience unforgettable.
