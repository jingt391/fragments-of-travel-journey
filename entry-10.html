            <p align="left"> While traveling in Trinidad, Cuba, 
                I had a memorable moment when I wore a pair of sandals all day. 
                The cobblestone streets of this historic city are as charming as they are difficult to navigate, 
                and the weight of exploration took my breath away as I strolled through the colorful streets. 
                I was asking for too much, walking from one attraction to the next, eager to soak in the vibrant culture and beauty that surrounded me. 
                But as I walked to a quaint little square, I suddenly felt a sharp pain. One of my sandals had broken. 
                It stayed there as did my passion for Cuba.</p>
