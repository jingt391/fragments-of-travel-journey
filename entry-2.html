            <p align="left">When I was four years old, I visited Tokyo Disneyland with my aunt. 
                I can't tell you how excited I was to enter this magical park with its bright colors,
                 whimsical rides, and unparalleled joy in the air. I vividly remember meeting beloved Disney 
                 characters and experiencing mesmerizing rides. However, there is one moment that stands out in my memory: 
                 I got lost in the park. I was overwhelmed by the huge crowds and towering attractions, and for a brief moment, 
                 I got separated from my aunt. The panic was real, but the kindness of the Disneyland staff and the eventual
                 reunion with my aunt made it all the more memorable. It was both an amazing and slightly frightening experience that I will never forget.
