                Durng that Summer in a mural project, 
                interviewing neighbors on the street to learn more about their lives and 
                what they would like to see on their walls. One of these interviews made a 
                lasting impression on me - a woman wearing a pink headscarf and a neon green top 
                was sitting at a bus stop. She recounted her struggles as a single mother of three, 
                abandoned by her children's father and with only her mother to support her. 
                Despite the hardships of life, she remained strong and emphasized the importance of 
                self-reliance. Before she left, she wrote her phone number on a piece of paper and left a message,
                 “If you need more stories, please call me.” Her resilience inspired me, and her request for “protection”
                in the mural prompted me to create the central gold shield that symbolizes strength and safety.
                 This experience taught me the power of personal stories and the profound impact of art in delivering messages of empowerment and resilience.
