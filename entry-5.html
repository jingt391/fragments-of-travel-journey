                I still remember the stack of Euro coins from 2010,
                a small but significant memento from my first trip to Europe with five of my closest family friends.
                It was a trip filled with the excitement, exploration and carefree joy that only traveling with loved ones can bring.
                As we strolled through the streets of Paris, and other European cities, 
                I collected these coins from a variety of places - each carrying a small adventure. Simple yet meaningful,
                this stack of coins represents more than just currency; it also symbolizes the moments we shared, the laughter,
                and the memories that have stayed with me over the years. Whenever I hold these coins,
                it's as if I'm transported back to the energizing days of my first trip to Europe, 
                where every corner seemed to hold something new and every day was an exploration of culture, history and friendship.
