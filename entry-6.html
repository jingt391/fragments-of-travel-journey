                During my visit to Yunnan, China, I received a genuine gift.
                 He handed me an exquisite flower folded in yuan, an art form I had never seen before. 
                 I was impressed by the intricate folds and the way the RMB was turned into something so beautiful. 
                 It was a thoughtful and unique gesture, combining the cultural significance of the RMB with the symbolic beauty of the flowers.
                 As he handed me the flower, he explained that it represented prosperity and good luck. Holding the flower, 
                I felt not only the warmth of our relationship, but also the kindness and creativity that reflected the depth of our bond,
                even though we are not related by blood. This simple but meaningful gift reminds me constantly of the generosity and depth feelings.
