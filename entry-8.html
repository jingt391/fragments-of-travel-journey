            <p align="left">On a trip to Lisbon, my mom and I left behind locks that symbolize love and wishes for the future.
                 As we stood at the railing and gazed at the beautiful river below the bridge, we decided to add our own locks to the collection. 
                 Surrounded by the city's charm, we carefully hung our locks on the bridge, engraved with our hopes for a safe and healthy family. 
                 It felt like a small, meaningful gesture - a way to express our gratitude and protection for those we love. As we threw the key into the river, 
                 we silently wished for good luck, knowing that the lock would stay there as an everlasting testament to our love and care for our family. 
                 It was a peaceful moment that my mom and I shared that felt both peaceful and powerful - a beautiful way to celebrate the bond between 
                 us and send our wishes out into the world.</p>
