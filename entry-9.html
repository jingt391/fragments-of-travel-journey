            <p align="left">During my trip to Mauritius, I had the privilege of learning to dive with 
                a wonderful instructor who made the experience even more memorable. On one of the diving trips, 
                as we were about to explore the vibrant coral reefs, my instructor with a warm smile handed me 
                a small flower clip to pin on my cap. It was a thoughtful gesture that added a personal touch to the adventure. 
                The flower was simple and beautiful, symbolizing the tropical charm of this island. I pinned it to my hat and it 
                stayed on my hat throughout the trip as a reminder of the fascinating underwater world I had discovered. To this day, 
                I still have this little flower clip as a souvenir of my good times and unforgettable memories in Mauritius.</p>
